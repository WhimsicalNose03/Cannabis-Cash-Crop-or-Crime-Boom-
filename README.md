# Cannabis: Cash Crop or Crime Boom?

Analyzing how crime rates may have been affected by the Legalization of Cannabis

# Inspiration and Goals
This project was inspired by an article I read on Forbes:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeadams/2018/03/28/california-officials-say-marijuana-legalization-causing-more-violent-crime/#357310d62c3b

It's a great read, but the tl;dr of it is this:

Since legalizing Cannabis in 2018, officials in Sonoma County, California report experiencing an uptick in violent crimes.  

In particular they mention a rise in "home invasions, violent crimes and robberies" perpetrated by people coming in from other states. The goal of my project is to determine if these "weed pirates" are having any significant impact on crime rates in regions where Cannabis has been legalized.

# Process
To see the long term effects of legalization I began by looking at crime data from Seattle, since Washington was the first state to fully legalize Cannabis.  I then gathered data from other cities in an attempt to find one with similar trends in the data.  I went through several cities before finding that Portland, Oregon would serve as the best comparison.

This focus of this project is weed piracy, so I decided to look at crime types I associated with piracy: Homicides, Thefts, Robberies, and Burglaries.

In order to make a fair comparison we need to verify that Portland and Seattle had similar crime rates before legalization occured in Washington in 2012.  This was accomplished using a set of hypotheses for running Hypothesis Tests:

H(null): There is no significant change in violent crime rates coinciding with legalization of Cannabis

H(alt): There is significant change in violent crime rates coinciding with legalization of Cannabis
