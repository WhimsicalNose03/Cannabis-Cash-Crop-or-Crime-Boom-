# Cannabis: Cash Crop or Crime Boom?
Analyzing how crime rates may have been affected by the Legalization of Cannabis

# Goal
This project was inspired by an article I read on Forbes:
https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeadams/2018/03/28/california-officials-say-marijuana-legalization-causing-more-violent-crime/#357310d62c3b

It's a great read, but the tl;dr of it is this:

Since legalizing Cannabis in 2018, officials in Sonoma County, California report experiencing an uptick in violent crimes.  

In particular they mention a rise in "home invasions, violent crimes and robberies" perpetrated by people coming in from other states.
The goal of my project is to determine if these "marijuana pirates" are having an impact on crime rates in regions where Cannabis has been legalized.
