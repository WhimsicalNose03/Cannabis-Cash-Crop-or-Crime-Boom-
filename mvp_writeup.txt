Question:
What effects does legalizing recreational marijuana use have on crime rates of different types?

Inspired by an article from Forbes:

H(null): Legalizing Marijuana has no significant correlation with crime rates

H(alt): Legalizing Marijuana has a significant correlation with changing crime rates.

P( increasingly lower crime rates | legalization has no effect)
I've altered my view to look at the per capita crime rates of specific types of crime, based on the article above:
Murder, Burglary, Larceny, Robbery, and Drug and Alcohol crime.

alpha = 0.05 

Right now my sample size is small so we're using t-tests.

My control group consists of data in LA before legalization and New York City.  

My test group is only Seattle at the moment; I decided to use this city first since Washington was the first state to fully legalize Cannabis.
At the point in time where Washington legalized both CA and NY had medical programs, and I figured these cities are more alike than not.

For MVP purposes I'm only looking at how yearly per capita crime rates may have been affected by legalization.  I assessed this based on the percent change in the per capita crime rate for each city.


                |   Drug/Alc    |  Murder  |   Larceny   |    Burglary    |    Robbery    |
  Control Cities               
Los Angeles     |    +7.09%     |  -1.03%  |    +6.04%   |     -5.87%     |     -11.8%    |
New York City   |   -9.67%      |  +77.9%  |    +4.11%   |    +1.30%      |    +1.26%     |

  Test City
Seattle         |   -11.6%      |  +2.17%  |    +0%      |    -5.50%      |     +0%       |

avg             |   -.82%       |  -.66%   |   -1.34%    |    -3.36%      |     -3.51%    |
t-stat          |   -1.42       |  -1.15   |   -2.33     |    -1.13       |     1.03      |
p-value         |   0.30        |  0.40    |   0.20      |    0.40        |     0.40      |

With a threshold set at 0.05 we find that none of the changes in per capita crime rate are statistically significant.
This is okay - part of this project is disproving the idea that violent crimes (murder) or weed piracy (burglary, larceny and robbery) are on the rise.
The results indicate that we cannot reject our H(null), not that it is proven.
Its also interesting that Drug and Alcohol crime is not statistically significant, although this could change once more cities are added to my control group.
