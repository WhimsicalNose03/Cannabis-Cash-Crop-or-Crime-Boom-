Question:
What effects does legalizing recreational marijuana use have on crime rates of different types?

Inspired by an article from Forbes:
https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeadams/2018/03/28/california-officials-say-marijuana-legalization-causing-more-violent-crime/#357310d62c3b

H(null): Legalizing Marijuana has no significant correlation with crime rates

H(alt): Legalizing Marijuana has a significant correlation with changing crime rates.

P( increasingly lower crime rates | legalization has no effect)
Since crime rates are falling every year, I've decided to look at the proportion of crime categories,
such as robbery, drug and alcohol, and public disorder to name a few.  
Different regions will have different categories of interest.

alpha = 0.05
Cost of a False Positive: 
positive = do reject
negative = cannot reject

Los Angeles, CA:

We can start by looking at CA, where Cannabis was fully legalized starting in Jan 2018.
Pick the most interesting/relevant plots:

Drug and Alcohol Crime - Just from logic we assume this will be lower, but porportions are relatively the same.
White Collar Crime - Plots show a drop off in 2018 when legalization began.  Is this drop off significant?
Public Disorder - Plots show a drop off in 2018, but proportionally we see this rise.
Theft from Vehicles - Plots show a drop off in 2018 when legalization began, but proportionally it looks like it goes up.
Robbery - According to the article mentioned in my preliminary write up, robberies have been on the rise.

Our analysis is tricky due to crime rates ALWAYS falling.  Instead of just looking for a decrease in crime overall,
I'm looking for differences in proportion - for example, what percentage of crime in LA was drug-alc related before legalization and after.

                    Pre-Legalization %  |  Post-Legalization % | Z-Score |  Test Statistic  |  P-Value  |
Drug/Alc            |       1.32%       |       1.50%          |  0.94   |      .8264       |   0.17    |
White Collar        |       7.78%       |       4.88%          |  -2.35  |      .0094       |   0.0094  |
Public Disorder     |       13.26%      |       13.51%         |  0.49   |      .6879       |   0.31    |
Theft from Vehicles |       13.17%      |       14.58          |  1.64   |      .9495       |   0.051   |
Robbery             |       4.52%       |       4.57%          |  0.11   |      .5438       |   0.46    |

Conclusions:

Of the 5 categories in this brief analysis, we find only two categories that may carry any significance:
    White Collar Crime and Theft from Vehicles.
    White Collar:
        We find a statistically significant trend downwards.
        One reason for a decrease in White Collar Crime could be a decrease in forgeries of Medical Marijuana prescriptions.
        This category includes all forgeries, and while the Medical system wasn't difficult to take advantage of I'm sure there were a few cases of prescription forgery.
        With Cannabis fully legalized that eliminates the need to forge a prescription.

    Theft from Vehicles:
        Trending up since Cannabis Legalization, barely on the cusp of being statistically significant.
        This one is a bit more difficult to understand.  Our p-value sits right on the edge of being significant, so I cannot dismiss these findings.
        One possible explanation for an increase in Theft from Vehicles could be that users of Cannabis are leaving their paraphernalia out in the open, 
        basically inviting thieves to get a good look at what they've got.

There were three categories that I expected to find significant results from, which ended up lacking:
    Drug/Alc Crime, Public Disorder and Robbery.
    Drug/Alc Crime:
        This is a category I felt like should've dropped considerably once Legalization came around, but we in fact see no significant change.
        While somewhat surprising, when we take into account that Cannabis has long been accepted in California we can come up with some theories.
        First off, many police officers in CA don't take Cannabis violations that seriously, especially with decriminalization having happened years before.
        This report only covers REPORTED crime, and while larger busts would still be on record I believe that small-time offenses rarely get reported.

    Public Disorder:
        Again, another category that I expected significant change in.  
        My logic was that if more people are walking around while inebriated, you'd get more crimes of this nature.
        I'm pleased to find that stoners can generally keep their cool and not cause disturbances in the streets while medicated.

    Robbery:
        After reading the Forbes article linked above, I expected to find some kind of significant increase in this category.  
        Our tests show no significant uptick, and I believe this has to do with the black market aspect of some of the targeted grow-houses:
            If a grow is not legal, the owners cannot call police and the crime cannot be reported. 
            Again, I can only analyze REPORTED crime events, so we may indeed have an influx of Pirates coming across state lines to smuggle Cannabis, it just goes unreported. 

After speaking with Moses today I'm not so sure this idea works:
Right now my p-values are done using proportions of crime, but a better idea we discussed is comparint states where Cannabis is legal to states where it is not.
Gotta go back and find new data, but I think I'll be able to get more out of the data this way.
