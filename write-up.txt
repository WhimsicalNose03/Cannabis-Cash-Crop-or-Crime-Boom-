H(null): Legalizing Marijuana has no significant effect on crime rates

H(alt): Legalizing Marijuana significantly lowers or increases crime rates

I have 15 broad categories of crime, 
I want to take a look at the top 5 most impacted ones for each city.

I'll start with Denver.  
We'll need plots for each type of crime,
with year_month on the x-axis and counts (or maybe rates) on the y-axis



Intro:
Marijuana Legalization is a process here in the US, and I believe that eventually every state will fully legalize Cannabis for retail sale.  While many studies have been done on the health risks and benefits that marijuana posseses, I wanted to examine if legalization had any significant effect on crime rates.  The inspiration for this project came from this article on Forbes:
